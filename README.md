  This example is for the combined OilLevel/Temoerature Sensor G266 of the VAG Family.
  There are two types of the Sensor:

  The "old" Version, used in 
  -Audi A4 (B5) 1.8 20V 
  -Audi A2 
  -VW Transporter T4
  -VW Golf 5 1.9 TDI
  -etc...

  The old Version has the Part Numbers 
  - 1J0 907 660 
  - 1J0 907 660 A
  - 1J0 907 660 B
  - 1J0 907 660 C
  - 1J0 907 660 F

  The old Version has a metal big Plate at the Bottom and the Tube to measure the oil is ONE PIECE and is formed in a rectangular form and NOT Square.


  The "new" Version, used in 
  - Audi A4, A6 from 2010
  - Audi Q5 from 2010
  - etc

  The new Version has the Part Numbers 
  03C 907 660 M


  In the new Version the Bottom is made of plastic and the Tube to measure the oil is Two PIECES. The Tube itself is formed in a H-Design and at the top of the Tube is a square 2nd Part



  This code is based on the Information from https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/459687 (which uses the "old" Version)

  The Sensor has 3 Pins

  Pinning:
  Pin    Pin    Pin 
   1      2      3
  12V    Gnd    Signal (High 200mV)


  - As Default Pin 2 used as an Input for the Signal of the Sensor 
  - As Default Pin 4 kind of Debug Pin to verify how often the Input ISR is triggered
  - As Default Pin 13 is used for an LED for the Oil level which turns on if theres is to low 
  - As Default Pin 15 is used for an LED to show the oil Temperature
    The LED is on if Engine is two cold
    The LED is off if Engine is in normal temperature area
    The LED toggles if the Engine is too Hot

  Circuit:
  Between the 3.3V output from the ESP 32 and the Input Pin is a 4.7K Ohm resistor as a Pullup resistor.
  The Output Signal Pin is connected to the InputPin of the ESP32
  The Ground of the Sensor is connected to Ground of the ESP32
  The 



        The Signal looks like the following

-        ______      _______                                   __
-        |     |     |     |                                  |
-        |     |     |     |                                  |
-        |     |     |     |                                  |
-      __|     |_____|     |__________________________________|
-      T1   T2   T3    T4                  T5                    T1
